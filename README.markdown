Important Notes
---------------

### Font Settings

Unfortunately, font settings are included with JetBrains WebIDE editor colours. You may wish to modify these in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font` after adding the colour schemes to your JetBrains WebIDE installation.

### Committing Changes

If you want to commit updates to the XML color scheme files, make sure to run the `build.sh` script before committing to generate an updated `settings.jar` file. This build script has been tested on Mac OSX and Linux. 

If you are using Windows and would like to commit a build script for the Windows platform, please do. It is a very simple shell script that should work from a Cygwin terminal but could equally be written as a BATCH script (`build.bat`) or using JScript in the Windows Scripting Host (`build.wsh`) or some other similar Windows scripting language.
